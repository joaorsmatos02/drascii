## Draw using ASCII

In `draw` mode, press any character key and use the mouse to draw with it. You can also define a sequence of characters to loop around or opt for random characters in the settings.

In `write` mode, it works as a regular text editor, allowing for more precise modifications and copy/paste.

### Controls

 - `Mouse 1` to draw (on `draw` mode)
 - `F1` to switch modes
 - `Mouse Wheel` to scroll vertically
 - `Shift Mouse Wheel` to scroll horizontally
 - `CTRL +` or `CTRL Mouse Wheel Up` to zoom in (increase font size)
 - `CTRL -` or `CTRL Mouse Wheel Down` to zoom out (decrease font size)
